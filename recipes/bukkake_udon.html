    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A mixture of soy, mirin, and sugar is blended with dashi to create a deeply flavorful broth in no time.</p>
    <p>Having your choice of toppings and condiments means the bowl can be exactly as you want it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1 tablespoon (15ml) mirin</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon (4g) sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>1/4 cup (60ml) soy sauce</p></li>
        <li><p>3/4 cup (180ml) homemade or instant dashi, chilled</p></li>
        <li><p>2 (7-ounce; 200g) servings store-bought udon noodles</p></li>
        <li><p>Assorted garnishes and toppings of your choice, such as bonito flakes, nori sheets, thinly sliced scallions, toasted sesame seeds, soft-cooked onsen eggs, grated fresh ginger, grated daikon radish, and pickled sliced ginger</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine mirin, sugar, and soy sauce in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Transfer to a bowl and set in the refrigerator to chill. (You can also rapidly cool by pouring mixture into a stainless steel mixing bowl and nesting that bowl in a slightly larger mixing bowl filled with ice water.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine 1/4 cup of the soy/mirin mixture (kaeshi) with dashi and stir. Taste mixture and add remaining kaeshi if desired. Keep chilled.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a medium pot of boiling water, cook udon until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes (or follow cooking time on package if it differs). Transfer to an ice bath to chill. Drain noodles well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer noodles to 2 soup bowls. Top with garnishes and condiments of your choice, then pour dashi broth into each bowl and serve.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>For the broth, you can use an equal quantity of instant dashi in place of the from-scratch dashi here, with excellent results. Feel free to play with the ratio of soy-mirin concentrate to dashi, using more dashi for a lighter, less salty broth or less dashi for a more intense flavor.</p>
